# Six Sigma course scripts
All the python scripts I authored for use in the course 'Six Sigma Tools and Techniques' taught at Carnegie Mellon University in the Tepper School of Business by Prof. Alan Scheller-Wolf. The scripts cover sampling (the python equivalent of the BINOMDIST function in Excel and plotting OC curve), control charts (Plotting the sampling data as an X_bar and R chart along with the limits) and script for fitting a linear model to the results of the DOE that was done in the lecture.
